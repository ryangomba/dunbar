Set up your environment by creating a `.env.local` file:

```
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URI=http://localhost:3000/graphql
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[Your Google client ID]
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you can use the normal scripts, e.g. to run:

```
yarn dev
```
